# NutriPup

## Description

NutriPup is a unique application designed for dog owners who are deeply interested in their furry friend's nutrition. Users can create personalized profiles for each of their dogs, inputting crucial information that allows the app to calculate and provide detailed daily nutritional needs, broken down by macronutrients. For those looking to take an extra step in ensuring their dog's well-being, NutriPup offers tailored recipe suggestions based on the dog's profile and any potential allergies. These recipes can be saved, edited, and revisited at any time, ensuring that your pup's meals are both nutritious and delicious.

### Motivation

The inspiration behind NutriPup stems from my personal experience during the pandemic, where I delved deep into understanding the nutritional needs of my English Bulldog, Stanley. He faced painful skin conditions and was slightly overweight, despite following the recommended portions on his dog food packaging. This led my husband and I to embark on a journey of canine culinary artistry. NutriPup was born out of the desire to share this knowledge and passion with fellow dog enthusiasts, providing a platform to ensure the health and happiness of their four-legged companions.
